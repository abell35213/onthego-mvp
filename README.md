## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A web server (optional for local development)
- Node.js 18+ (for the Yelp proxy server)
- Yelp Fusion API key (optional - app works with sample data)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abell35213/onthego.git
cd onthego
```

### 2. Get a Yelp API Key (Optional)

The app works with sample data out of the box, but for real restaurant data:

1. Go to [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)
2. Create a Yelp account or log in
3. Create a new app to get your API key
4. Copy your API key

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` and add your Yelp API key:
   ```
   YELP_API_KEY=your_actual_yelp_api_key_here
   ```
3. (Optional) Adjust the cache TTL in `.env` if you want a different caching window.

### 4. Run the Application

#### Option A: Node + Express (Recommended for Yelp data)
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

#### Option B: Simple HTTP Server (Python)
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

#### Option C: Node.js HTTP Server
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

#### Option D: VS Code Live Server
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

#### Option E: Open Directly
For basic testing, you can open `index.html` directly in your browser. Note: Some features may not work due to CORS restrictions.

### 5. Enable Location Services

When prompted by your browser, **allow location access** to see restaurants near you. If you deny access, the app will default to San Francisco, CA.

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Finding Restaurants
1. **Open the app** - The map will center on your current location
2. **Browse the list** - Scroll through nearby restaurants in the sidebar
3. **Click a marker** - View restaurant details in a popup
4. **Click a card** - Pan the map to that restaurant's location

### Filtering & Searching
- **Search**: Type in the search bar to find restaurants by name or cuisine
- **Filter by cuisine**: Select a cuisine type from the dropdown
- **Filter by price**: Choose a price range
- **Sort**: Change the sort order (rating, distance, reviews)

### Taking Action
- **View on Yelp**: Read reviews and see more photos
- **Order delivery**: Click Uber Eats, DoorDash, or Grubhub
- **Make a reservation**: Use OpenTable or Resy
- **Check social media**: Visit Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter

### Mobile Usage
- **Swipe** to scroll through the restaurant list
- **Tap** a card to see it on the map
- **Tap** action buttons to visit external sites
- **Pinch/zoom** the map as needed

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Default Location
Edit `js/config.js`:
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    DEFAULT_LAT: 40.7128,  // New York City
    DEFAULT_LNG: -74.0060,
    DEFAULT_ZOOM: 13,
    // ...
};
```

### Adjusting Search Radius
Edit `js/config.js`:
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    SEARCH_RADIUS: 3000,  // 3km instead of 5km
    SEARCH_LIMIT: 30,     // Show up to 30 restaurants
    // ...
};
```

### Using Custom Mock Data
Edit the `MOCK_RESTAURANTS` array in `js/config.js` to add your own sample restaurants.

## 🎨 Customization

### Color Scheme
The app uses CSS variables for easy theming. Edit `css/styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #FF6B35;    /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #004E89;  /* Secondary accent */
    --accent-color: #F77F00;     /* Highlight color */
    /* ... */
}
```

### Styling
All styles are in `css/styles.css`. The design is mobile-first with responsive breakpoints at:
- 768px (tablet)
- 1024px (desktop)
- 480px (small mobile)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Location Not Working
- **Check browser permissions**: Ensure location access is allowed
- **Try HTTPS**: Geolocation requires HTTPS in production
- **Fallback**: The app will use San Francisco as default

### No Restaurants Showing
- **Check API key**: Verify your Yelp API key in `.env`
- **Check server**: Ensure the Node/Express proxy is running (`npm start`)
- **Mock data**: The app should show sample data if API fails
- **Console errors**: Check browser console for error messages

### CORS Issues with Yelp API
The Yelp API has CORS restrictions. For production use:
- Run the included Node/Express proxy (`npm start`)
- Use a CORS proxy service
- Or rely on the built-in mock data for demos

### Map Not Loading
- **Check internet**: Leaflet requires internet for tiles
- **CDN access**: Ensure CDN resources aren't blocked
- **Console errors**: Check for JavaScript errors

## 🚀 Deployment

### Static Hosting (Recommended)
Deploy to any static hosting service:

- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Use the existing `.do` directory
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the entire folder
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo
- **GitHub Pages**: Enable in repo settings
- **AWS S3**: Upload files to an S3 bucket

### Server Deployment
For Yelp API integration without CORS issues:
1. Deploy the included Node/Express proxy (`server.js`)
2. Set `YELP_API_KEY` and `PORT` in your production environment
3. Serve the static assets from the same server or a frontend host pointed at `/api/yelp-search`
